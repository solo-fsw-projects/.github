# SOLO FSW Projects

This organisation contains repositories for (mainly collaborative) projects done by SOLO FSW.

## Repository naming conventions

The repositories in this organisation follows the naming convention `<Lab/section/institute>-<PI/lead-researcher if applicable>-<Project name/description>-<Date/Year if applicable>`. In this convention, clauses are written using lower-case letters and numbers. Underscores are used as spaces within clauses (snake_case). Dashes are used to separate clauses.
